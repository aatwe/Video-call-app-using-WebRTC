API: Audio video streams in browser

-> can est peer to peer connection bw 2 browsers

> without 3rd party server or Native app


a) First peer create offer for second
	a.1) STP object created 	//contains what? connection info: codec/timing etc
Ex
v: (protocol version number)
0: (originator and session identifier)
5: (session name)
i=* (session title or short information)
u=* (URI of description)
e=* (zero or more email address with optional name of contacts)
p=* (zero or more phone number with optional name of contacts)
b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
z=* (time zone adjustments)
k=* (encryption key)
a=* (zero or more session attribute lines)
m: (media name and transport address)
i=* (media title or information field)
c=* (connection information)
b=* (zero or more bandwidth information lines)
k=* (encryption key)
a=* (zero or more media attribute lines)


	a.2) Where data saved? server

b) Peer 2 reads data from server -> answer
	How? STP Ans -> send to that server
//Signalling server //does not touch data	


What problem? devices behind firewalls ---> IP change constantly (How? network address translation)

	peer to peer is difficult from networking perspective

Solution? Interactive Connectivity Establishment //helps find public face in IP
	How?
	a) generate list of ICE CAndidates : contains what? IP + PORT for peer 1
		How?
	b) WebRTC
		in background --> make series of requests to --> STUN Server (Session Transversal utilities for NAT) //can setup using google
		ICE Candidates sof Peer 1 tored in DB in STUN Server
		Other peerr reads

		WebRTC Algo: finds which candidate is best
		Realtime media will flow
